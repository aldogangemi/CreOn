# CreOn
An integrated ontology of creativity theories, using OWL2:

(a) Personal creativity:
Wallace's personal creativity phases,
Guilford's personal creativity traits,
Smith's cognitive creativity,
Moruzzi's personal creativity keys

(b) social creativity:
Csikszentmihali's domain/field of creativity,
Amabile's expertise/thinking/motivation,
Sternberg's creative personal traits

(c) dual personal/social creativity:
Gardner's multidimensional theory (personality plus context),
Rhodes' 4P theory,
Simonton's c/C, creativity function theory, divergence/error,
Corazza's mental/social process,
Jenning's computational creativity,

(d) neuro creativity:
Kenett's metaanalysis of neural correlates of creativity

Some important questions need special investigation, concerning computational creativity, fruition, and opera aperta:

- AI is not a person, and how could we distinguish between personal and social for an LLM?

- Opera aperta goes beyond production vs. fruition (the patina of a monument, table, and metaphorically a book or a painting, let alone Sistine Chapel colors ...)

Specific folders (e.g., 4Pexp for Rhodes' 4P theory) will contain data and code for experiments dealing with creativity categories and correlation to personal traits.
